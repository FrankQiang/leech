The leech user is here to manage torrent downloads and other leeching,
how do I..?

= Start a torrent download

Place the .torrent file you want to download in
/home/leech/torrent/queue/

= Monitor my download

ssh leech@nix.is
screen -rx

DON'T use screen -rd as that will detach everyone else from the
screen. (And on that subject read the `Not fuck shit up' section)

= Start the torrent screen

If the torrent screen hasn't been started already this is how you
start it:

See if any screen is running already:
    
    leech@t:~$ screen -ls
    No Sockets found in /var/run/screen/S-leech.

No? Start it:
    
    leech@t:~$ screen
    [detached]

Now you can see it has been started:

    leech@t:~$ screen -ls
    There is a screen on:
            19583.pts-3.t   (Detached)
    1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-leech.

Then just re-attach as normal with screen -rx

= View/change the configuration

All the configuration for the leech user is stored in git. Edit stuff
in ~leech/leech and commit/push/pull as appropriate. You can also edit
it under your own cloned repository and push back if you're in the
leech group.

= Not fuck shit up

Read the screen manual via `info screen` to know what you're doing and
the rtorrent manual at `man rtorrent'. The screen `fit' command is of
particular interest.

is also a good resource.
